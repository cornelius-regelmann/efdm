  #to tmp, and saved again to s.
  
  #2: On the 2nd round, tmp is 3-dimensional, standing for the 2-dimensional
  #frequency tables of the changing factor levels, one for each level of the
  #first non-changing factor.
  #The 2-dimensional table of prior "frequencies" in s obtained on the first
  #round is summed to each 2-dimensional factor1 specific subtable 
  #of tmp, and the 3-dimensional result is saved again to s.
  
  #3: On the 3rd round, tmp is 4-dimensional, standing for the 2-dimensional
  #frequency tables of the changing factor levels, one for each combination 
  #of the levels of the first 2 non-changing factors.
  #The 2-dimensional tables of prior "frequencies" in s obtained on the second
  #round for each level of the first non-changing factor, are summed to each
